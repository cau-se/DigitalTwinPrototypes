# This Video was recorded during the ARCHES Demonstration Mission
On the left side of the video, the digital twins of Mansio - a stationary sensor hub - and Viator, a crawler equipped with a camera, are displayed. In the captured scenario, we broadcast a command to the network, altering the behavior of all systems. The video captures Mansio activating its lights and Viator slowly moving backward. A split-screen format is used to show that the digital twins replicate the actions of their physical counterparts with a small delay
